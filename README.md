# MODULE 2 INTRO CRAWLS

# Week 4

## The Rise of the “DOM”

There was a time of great unrest in the cohort...  While the young padawan
programmers were beginning to hone their skills in the ways of JavaScript, they
were still uncertain of how to navigate through the perils and pitfalls of the
almighty browser...

Along came Jedi Instructor Alissa, with her advanced knowledge of the Document
Object Model, to teach the padawans how to select and manipulate the html
elements around them.  Equipped with a ship full of html tags, event listeners,
and the support of her faithful crew of TA's, she is prepared to return peace
and browser support to the cohort…


# Week 5

## Attack of the Classes

Peace was restored to the cohort, as the padawan programmers were now
manipulating the DOM with great ease, and even winning a few games of
tic-tac-toe…. 

But turmoil was right around the corner, as a rogue squadron of Constructor
Functions flooded through the galaxy, causing great destruction with their pre
ES2015 syntax. It was bad, really bad. 

Thankfully Jedi Instructor Alissa was prepared for such an onslaught and
skillfully demonstrated some class syntax to her students!  New classes were
instantiated everywhere, outfitted with the latest in disruptor method
technology making quick work of the rogue Constructor Functions, and bringing
peace back to the galaxy, at least until Week 6…
